# Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment for contributors and users, all developers and maintainers of Kitten are asked to respect and help enforce reasonable standards of discourse and behavior.

## Rules

* As the main developer of Kitten, I, Jon Purdy, have the last word in directing the project and its community.

* You are my guest, joining me here in my workshop. Please be courteous and respectful toward my other guests.

* Contributions will be considered on their own merit, regardless of the person submitting them, provided that the contributor uphold this Code of Conduct.

* It is both off-topic and inappropriate to make comments or actions of a sexual, violent, disruptive, or discriminatory nature, to discuss irrelevant personal details, or to allow them to influence treatment of other contributors in any way. Such details include, but are not limited to: age, appearance, disability, ethnicity, gender, nationality, politics, sex, race, and religion.

* We should all strive to be inclusive, welcoming, and empathetic toward each other; respectfully offer and graciously accept constructive criticism; and focus on objective technical discussion.

* It’s just a programming language—chill.

## Enforcement

Failure to uphold the spirit of Kitten and its Code of Conduct in good faith may result in repercussions as determined at my sole discretion. I reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject any contribution, or to temporarily suspend or permanently ban any contributor, for behaviors that I deem inappropriate or harmful.

Any concerns pertaining to this Code should be raised by contacting me privately, so that I may confidentially address the issue at hand. Discussion of conduct issues in public project spaces is also considered a violation of this Code. I will review all complaints and respond as I see fit.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct shall be upheld in project spaces, as well as in public spaces if a contributor is representing Kitten or speaking in an official capacity about it.
